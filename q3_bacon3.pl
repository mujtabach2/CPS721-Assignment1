% Add the required statements in the q3a_can_reach_through_2_movies section below.
% Any helper predicates should also be added to that section.
% Do NOT delete, edit, or add SECTION headers.
% If you put statements in the wrong section, you will lose marks.

%%%%% SECTION: q3c_kb_import
% The following line will import your movie KB. You can feel free to
% edit this line if you want to import and test on different KBs.
% We will ignore this section when testing your code, and instead test
% on our own KBs.
:- [q1_movie_kb].



%%%%% SECTION: q3c_can_reach_through_2_movies
% You define canReachThrough2Movies and any helper predicates below.
% If you decide to reuse your canReach and canReachThroughMovie implementations from q3a 
% and q3b as part of this solution, include it below. To avoid collision if you first compile
% q3_bacon1 and then q3_bacon2, we suggest you rename canReach to something else.
% Do NOT use an import statement like the one in section q3c_kb_import to import and reuse
% your answer to parts (a) and (b) below. 

% Done going through needed movies, just find rest of path
