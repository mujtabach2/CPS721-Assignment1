% Add the required statements in the correct section below.
% You should not use helper predicates for these queries.
% Do NOT delete, edit, or add SECTION headers.
% If you put statements in the wrong section, you will lose marks.

% You may add additional comments as you choose but DO NOT MODIFY 
% the already included comment lines below

% Add your solution queries in section q1_movie_queries below. The argument in the query
% should be the answer to question given in natural language. Note that the first
% query does not have such an answer, which is why it has no argument. The constant 
% query1 will thus be true or false if the query is asked correctly.
%
% To test your queries, first compile this file in ECLiPSe. Doing so will first
% load your KB, and then create a rule for each query. You can then test a query
% (for example query 5), by entering the following in interactive mode.
%
% > query5(D).
%
% Note that the value assigned to each variable in the body of each rule is not 
% printed out. For example, if you have the following rule
%
% query99(X) :- pred1(Y), pred2(X, Y), pred3(Z).
%
% then calling query(X) will only print out X if it succeeds. Thus, for debugging,
% it may be useful to test your queries directly as
%
% > pred1(Y), pred2(X, Y), pred3(Z).
%
% as doing so will print the values of all of X, Y, and Z. However, ensure that your
% final submission follows the required format, and works as expected.
